Bento4 is a C++ class library and tools designed to read and write ISO-MP4 files.
This format is defined in international specifications ISO/IEC 14496-12, 14496-14 and 14496-15.
The format is a derivative of the Apple Quicktime file format, so Bento4 can be used to read and write most Quicktime files as well.

Features
--------

A number of formats and features based on the ISO-MP4 format and related technologies are also supported, including:

 * MPEG DASH with fragmented MP4 files, as defined in ISO/IEC 23009-1
 * MPEG Common Encryption (CENC) as specified in ISO/IEC 23001-7
 * PIFF (Protected Interoperable File Format): encrypted, fragmented MP4 format specified by Microsoft and used for encrypted HTTP Smooth Streaming.
 * Reading and writing 3GPP and iTunes-compatible metadata.
 * ISMA Encrytion and Decryption as defined in the ISMA E&A specification
 * OMA 2.0 and 2.1 DCF/PDCF Encryption and Decryption as defined in the OMA specifications.
 * ISO-MP4 files profiled as part of the 3GPP family of standards.
 * The UltraViolet (DECE) CFF (Common File Format).
 * Parsing and multiplexing of H.264 (AVC) video and AAC audio elementary streams
 * Support for multiple DRM systems that are compatible with MP4-formatted content (usually leveraging CENC Common Encryption), such as Marlin, PlayReady and Widevine.
 * Support for a wide range of codecs, including H.264 (AVC), H.265 (HEVC), AAC, AC3 and eAC3 (Dolby Digital), DTS, ALAC, and many more.

Design
------

The SDK is designed to be cross-platform. The code is very portable; it can be compiled with any sufficiently modern C++ compiler. The implementation does not rely on any external library. All the code necessary to compile the SDK and tools is included in the standard distribution. The standard distribution contains makefiles for unix-like operating systems, including Linux and Android, project files for Microsoft Visual Studio, and an XCode project for MacOS X and iOS. There is also support for building the library with the SCons build system.


License
-------

The library is Open Source, with a dual-license model. You can find out more about the license on the About Page.
The Developers Page contains specific information on where to obtain the source code and documentation. The Downloads Page contains the links to pre-built SDKs and tools that you can use to get started quickly.

Building
--------

The code can be built either by using the pre-configured IDE project files (Mac OSX, iOS and Windows), or compiled/cross-compiled using the SCons build system or CMake, or compiled using Make.
Target platform specific build files and configurations are located under subdirectories Buid/Targets/xxxx where xxxx takes the form ```<architecture>-<vendor>-<os>```. For example, the Linux x86 target specific files are located under ```Build/Targets/x86-unknown-linux```. The XCode project files for Mac OSX are located under ```Build/Targets/universal-apple-macosx```.

### Mac OSX and iOS using XCode
Open the XCode project file Build/Targets/universal-apple-macosx/Bento4.xcodeproj and build

### Windows using Visual Studio
Open the Visual Studio solution file Build/Targets/x86-microsoft-win32-vs2010/Bento4.sln and build

### On Linux and other platforms, using SCons
Make sure you the the SCons build tool installed on your host machine (http://www.scons.org).
To build the Debug configuration, simply enter the command:

```scons -u```

in a terminal from any directory (either from the top level directory where you downloaded the Bento4 distribution, or from the Build/Targets/xxx subdirectory for your specific target).

To build the Release configuration, use the command:

```scons -u build_config=Release```

To cross-compile for a target other than your host architecture, specify target=xxxx as an argument to the scons build command.

Example:

```scons -u build_config=Release target=x86_64-unknown-linux```

### Using CMake
CMake can generate Makefiles, Xcode project files, or Visual Studios project files.

#### CMake/Make
	mkdir cmakebuild
	cd cmakebuild
	cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
	make

#### CMake/Xcode
	mkdir cmakebuild
	cd cmakebuild
	cmake -G Xcode -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..

#### CMake/Visual Studio
	mkdir cmakebuild
	cd cmakebuild
	cmake -G "Visual Studio 10 Win64" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..


### Using Make
From a command shell, go to your build target directory.

For Debug builds:
	```make```

For Release builds:
```make AP4_BUILD_CONFIG=Release```
